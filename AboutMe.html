    <p class="about">There are many different stories, and evidence proving that I have a lot of passion for technology and programming. The first piece of the story is that since I was a little kid, I have been interested in learning about how computers work. I have also played a lot of games since I was young, while wanting to learn how they work. The main games I played when I was little were the Skylanders games because I loved the fantasy world of how the characters used their supernatural abilities to try and save the world after it had been taken over by a great evil. Another story is that when I was in sixth grade, I frequently helped my English teacher with her technology problems. She was so impressed with my technology that she told me that one day I would become the CEO of a big technology company. These experiences inspired me to take the Gaming and Multimedia class at Questar III. Before I entered this class, I thought I might want to become a programmer because I have always liked critical thinking and problem solving, but I was not sure. I also had creative ideas for games and technology innovations that I wanted to bring to life. Once I started the class, I realized that I really enjoyed the programming side of things. I even began learning extra topics on programming on my own, such as object-oriented programming. Finally, the moment I decided my specialization within programming was last year when my teacher for the Gaming and Multimedia class, Mr.Stevenson, showed us the Google DeepMind documentary. The way that this documentary showed the positive impacts on society that AI can make, made me realize that I wanted to become a machine learning engineer.

<p class="about">I have gained quite a bit of experience over time that is relevant to this work. The first game I worked on was just a simple platformer that had a teleportation mechanic and boss fights. Developing it taught me the fundamentals of programming. The challenges with developing this game were trying to understand how to put the logic into Construct, a game engine that was developed for beginners. This was because, at the time, I had no relevant experience before this.  I overcame these challenges by asking another student to help me in the beginning, and they showed me about the dictionary in Construct. After that, I used the knowledge that I learned from the other student and went through the event list and dictionary while testing and debugging until I got the result that I wanted. The next major project I worked on was Fightatron,  the final project for junior year. This project helped me master the fundamentals of programming and helped me gain time management skills, as we had to complete large amounts of work in short periods of time. Also, I am currently interning at Werewolf Moon Studios. Within this internship, I am learning everything there is to know about Unreal Engine and C++. After I master the basics, I will contribute to some of the projects that the studio is currently working on. This will also allow me to learn how the industry works and how to collaborate with others on a personal level. A unique challenge with this internship is teaching what I learned to the CEO of the business, as if he were a beginner. The way I overcame this was by making sure that I understood each topic to the point that I could explain it to a five-year-old. Finally, I am currently working on Overwrought, my SkillsUSA game. This game uses Unreal Engine, so I am planning on mastering C++ and Unreal Engine by the end of this project. Another skill I am practicing with this project is time management, since the goals of this project are very ambitious and we have a short time frame. The main challenge with this project is that I am still new to Unreal Engine and there are still a lot of things to learn. The way I overcame this challenge was by remembering that every time I learned a new technology, it was confusing at first, but after a bit, it became easier.

<p class="about"> There are many goals I have within the field of technology. My first goal is to win the SkillsUSA state competition by dedicating as much time as I can while still having time to complete my other obligations. After that, I am inspired to get another internship at a bigger technology company, this time for C++ programming, this summer at the earliest, by using my experience up and presenting it on my resume in a coherent way. I would also practice the technical interview, so I can get the internship. The final step to getting this internship would be to use every form of networking that I have at my disposal. The next steps after that would be to get multiple internships through college. I would use the same method that I used to get the internship, but just keep improving over time. After I graduate from college, I plan on getting a full-time job at a tech company, and eventually, advancing to higher-level positions by working hard and proving my knowledge by putting all my experience on my resume and mastering the interview process. To conclude, I would like to put a quote that signifies the work that I stand for "We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard," John F. Kennedy.
