    <p>game concept follows you the player in your mind, dealing with past trauma by going to emotional states in your head. The main selling point of our game is the logic-based puzzles in the game that the player has to complete in order to unlock items which trigger different events in your life. 

Every event tells a story and in every level it’s own intricate puzzle to go along with the vibe of every level. 

Genre: 3D First Person, Logic-Puzzle Game.</p>
