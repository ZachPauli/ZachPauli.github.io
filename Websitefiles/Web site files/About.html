<p style="color: rgb(116, 114, 46);">I am the author, I have created this website to show other people that they should give Soft core country music 
    a try to and lison. The reson I wanted to do this is because I use to not like lisoning to music at all untill I found some music that I like the reson I picked this type
    and instead of the type of misic that got me into lisoning to misic in the first place is because I took a year long brake from lisoning untill my friend showed me soft core 
    country music.

<img src="Images/Pixelartsunset.jpg" alt="Pixel art sunset"> 
<P style="color: aquamarine;"> The reason I choose this image is because the music is a lot of times about the sunset or the sun. I picked the pixel art verson because I think that it looks cool and links to 
 programing because pixel is made on computers as well.
