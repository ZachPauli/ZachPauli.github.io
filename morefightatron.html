    <p class="fightatronmore">With the project we only had one month to work on it. The challenge was trying to set up the game so it does not have many noticable bugs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="fightatronmore">Even after I thought I had fixed a bug I came back to work on it the next day and the bug was back again.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="fightatronmore">To aviod having to go to and change the code later leading to more bugs or making waste time on writing the same code over and over I had to plan ahead and also use functions. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="fightatronmore">Anther problem that I ran into is that I was working with anther programmer, the other programmer was working with, and he did not use functions or plan ahead, that was a challenge to try to figure out what he was trying to do with the code. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="fightatronmore">The way I over came with challenge is by slowly looking though the code and testing it, for context this problem occurred during a long weeken when I was unable to contact this programmer untill we returned to school the next week. </p>
