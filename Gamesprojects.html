    <p class="Mania">This is the first game I made. It is a platforming game where the player can Teleport from platform to platform. There are many challenges within the game such as 
        bosses

    <p class="Zen">A puzzle game where the player can not go back though the steeps they already went though and the player has to end on outside of the tiles.
       The reson I made this game difficult is because I like changes in games. The challenge also shows how when I coding and program it makes me think 
       though just like the player does in this game.
